# CRinHPPI

This is the repository for our graduation project, Text Mining for Infectious Diseases.

## Motivation

Infectious diseases occur through interactions of proteins of the host and the pathogen. So, these interactions are important in investigation and possible medicine of infectious diseases. We want to extract host pathogen protein protein interactions (HP-PPIs) from biomedical corpus for this purpose.

We work on the problem of **coreference resolution in biomedical domain**, whose solution will greatly contribute to the solution of extracting HPPIs we believe.
